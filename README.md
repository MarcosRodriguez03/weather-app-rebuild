Peer Review: Good Job, I like the design of your website, it's mobile responsive, and it even looks very very similar to its figma design. One thing I would recommend is having a hover effect that makes the mouse a pointer mouse on things that are clickable like the favorites button and the favorites, you should also make the magnifying glass icon clickable too. Also some things are hard to see like the gray low temperature text in the 5 day forecasts, I would recommend maybe changing that to make it more visible. Some bugs you need to fix are, when you delete a favorite city, it will automatically enter that city in the search, and when I'm on one of my favorite cities, your website will change the favorite icon when I try to search an incorrect city name like 'hock or eee'.Looking at your code I liked how you used lots of conditional statements like if else's, but I feel like for some of those you can use a switch case instead. Other than some critiques and errors, I really like how you were able to get my actual location by leveraging the geolocation endpoint. And I also liked how you implemented higher order methods, dot notation/index notation, ternary operators, the && operators, and etc. Overall, good job!!














This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
